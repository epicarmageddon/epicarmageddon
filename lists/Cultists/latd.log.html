<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Lost und the Damned list is based on the developmental NetEA "Redux" version, splitting off all Imperial Guard Verbände into a separate list: Slaves to Darkness. The original Lost und the Damned list was very thematic, giving huge flexibility, but mit rather too many ingredients that we think are better off in zwei separate lists.
</p>
<p>
    Restrictions: The biggest difference between the Redux list und the EA:Ragnarök version is the quite harsh restrictions on the number of jeweils Daemon Engine formation, since playtest revealed that certain Verbände were quite spammable, mit the list often becoming a Kriegsmaschine list mit some cultists thrown in. There is also the thematic restriction that the list cannot mix Verbände from factions that hates jeweils other, which seems fitting given the "old school" theme of a list named after eine of the iconic 40k/WHFB Chaos Books.
</p>
<p>
    Factions: All cultist Verbände are now undivided, making the list both more flexible but also makes it a lot easier to remember what jeweils formation does. The prohibition of hated factions in the list also removes the the need für a Animösität rule.
