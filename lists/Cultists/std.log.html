<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Slaves to Darkness list is intended to the be the repository für all the Traitor Imperial Guard stuff that was left over when Lost und the Damned became a pure cultist list. It also is a great alternative für those who prefers the Alpha Legion to be more generically chaotic than the main, Heresy themed, list.
</p>
<p>
    Making an "Imperial Guard mit Daemons"-list is actually pretty hard, since the combination of IG's Feuerkraft mit the Engage potential of Daemons means that it very easily ends up being overpowered. To combat this the list is very rigid und only has a single Kern formation (that on the other hand is quite flexible). Unlike LatD it has no Greater Daemons und has a fairly limited Support section. The 33% Chaos Allies section is on the other hand quite extensive, mit plenty of alternatives für different builds.

<h5>Additional nerfs, boosts & tweaks</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Chaos Navy: Für thematic reasons the Verbände der Imperialen Luftstreitkräfte didn't make it into StD. The idea behind this is that it seems unlikely that Traitor Guard Verbände would be able to get hold of Imperiale Luftstreitkräfteassets like Thunderbolts oder Marauder Bombers. Those kinds of assets are better represented by the Chaos Navy.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 1.0.beta-2</h4>
<p>
    The Kern formation was made slightly more rigid, as it was a bit too flexible before. Lesser daemons bumped by 5 Punkte to cost the same as in Chaos Space Marine lists.
</p>
<h4>Version 1.0.beta-3</h4>
<p>
    In line mit changes made to Imperial Guard Super Heavy Panzers, Baneblades are slightly cheaper und only has 4+ FF.
