<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
	The EA:Ragnarök Daemonic Incursion list is a completely new list, based partly on the Lost und the Damned army. During its development it has had an impact on all chaos lists, as certain units had to be tweaked für purely Daemonic Verbände to make sense. Daemonic armies are both very explosive, as they can engage out of Chaos Gates und Warp Rifts to devastating effect, but are also quite fragile, as daemonic Verbände are destroyed when becoming broken.

	Exalted Große Dämonen These collectively both serve the function as the list's BTS, its Oberbefehlshabers, und für determining which powers can be included in the army. Like all EA:Ragnarök lists, DI suffers from Eternal Animösität.

	Brittle Verbände: While most daemons are Entbehrlich, daemonic Verbände are very sensitive to clipping assaults, which requires careful planning on the daemon Spieler's part. Units which can countercharge more than 5cm can be particularly useful für ensuring that the entire formation gets to fight.
