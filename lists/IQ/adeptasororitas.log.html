<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Adepta Sororitas list is based on the E-UK version of the list, but with some siginficant changes to force structure, stats und Sonderregels.
</p>
<p>
    Gläubig: The Gläubig rule has been revised succeed automatically, but only if the formation carries out an Engage action that leads to an Assault. This makes this rule less abusable, in particular it prevents Furchtlos Aufklärers from marching up und blocking off entire sections of the battlefield. In addition, Verbände that use the Gläubig rule counts as having a character with 'Inspirierend' in the formation.
</p>
<p>
    The Exorcists have been split into zwei versions (eine direct fire (Prioris) und eine equipped mit einemWhirlwind Raketenwerfer (Sanctorum)). The Exorcist Prioris have longer range but worse AT. It also have a 5+ Armour, since it is based on the Rhino.
</p>
<p>
    Battle Sisters: This formation have had their Heavy Flammenwerfer replaced with Schwerer Bolter, as we found them to be somewhat too strong with Heavy Flammenwerfer. Battle Sisters Mission is also the sole Kern formation in the Army, but is more flexible with options to replace Battle Sisters with Exorcist Prioris oder to ride in a Sororitas Stormlord.
</p>
<p>
    No mixed Sister Verbände: In order to reduce confusion für Spielers (there are quite a few types of "Sisters" in the list), jeweils type of Sister unit now has its own type of formation, with the Celestial Sisters merging with the Immolator formation to create a quite expensive but very nasty Immolation formation.
</p>
<p>
    Maschinengeists: Certain units which are basically servitors und are regarded as cannon fodder have been given the Maschinengeist rule, und are also Furchtlos und Entbehrlich. These units are now Erweiterungen to the Redemptionist formation.
</p>
<p>
    Imperial Navy: The Lightning Strike Fighters have been replaced with the Lightning Interceptor, und the ground attack role been taken over by the Marauder Destroyer, which also replaces the Marauder Schwadron. Since the list now contains Exorcist Sanctorums these are less needed.
</p>
