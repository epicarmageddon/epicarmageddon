<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Dark Eldar, Kabal of the Black Heart list is based on the Epic UK version of the list. There are no major differences, but a number of smaller changes have been made.
</p>
<p>
    The 'Fleet of Foot' special army rule now also grants Dark Eldar Verbände a +1 bonus when attempting a March action, to further encourage the use of this unique aspect of the army.
</p>
<p>
    Certain units now have the 'Schnell wie der Wind' Sonderregel, which removed the penalty für shooting when doing a Double, but the unit no longer gains +1 when doing Sustain Fire.
</p>
<p>
    The Syndicate Kern formation is more expensive, und has a compulsory Dracon character. This is because it felt a bit too obvious in the list, at the expense of the list's Partisan Verbände, which have generally been made slightly better over all.
</p>
<p>
    The Vessel of Pain has slightly different stats, again because it seemed a bit too powerful compared to its Punkte.
</p>
<p>
    To make the lack of AA in the list less extreme, Ravagers und the Barge of Pleasure now has a 30cm AA6+ attack.
</p>
<p>
    The Executioner Landing Module is significantly cheaper, but with different stats. In a list mit einemcompulsory BTS, its cost was a bit too much to motivate actually taking.
</p>
<p>
    The Partisan section of the list have many Verbände mit very similar functions. Some minor tweaks have been made to differentiate between these, giving clearer strenghts und weaknesses. The Wych Cult für example has 1+ Initiative Rating, while the Talos Swarm gained the Infiltratoren Sonderregel.
</p>

<h5>Additional nerfs, boosts & tweaks</h5>
<ul>
    <li>The Portable Tor zum Netz der tausend Tore is bought as an upgrade to a character in the army, not as a separate choice.</li>
    <li>The Archon character now has the Furchtlos Sonderregel.</li>
    <li>The Voidraven has slightly different stats.</li>
    <li>Ravagers have 5+ FF.</li>

<h5>Version 1.0.beta-2</h5>
<p>
    In order to make the Vessel of Pain a bit more interestig as a formation, it is now also Schnell wie der Wind, opening up a more hit und run role für it. To keep things consistent, the Barge of Pleasure is also Schnell wie der Wind.
