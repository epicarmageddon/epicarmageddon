<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Kabal of the Wraithkind army list is based on the Kabal of the Black Heart list, swapping out certain Verbände für alternatives, und cutting others in favor of adding the Harlequins to Epic Armageddon. Harlequins obviously has a lot of very interesting background und fluff, but is very much a warband-sized army that doesn't really qualify as an Epic army on their own. Pairing them up with Dark Eldar, an army that is quite hard to vary enough to motivate having more than eine army, seemed like the most sensible move, und also made für a handy excuse to create another Dark Eldar list!

    Harlequins have been quite a challenge to get right, mit einemlot of different mechanics und configurations having been tested through the years. The current mix of fluff und Sonderregels has so far turned out to be a fair balance between durability, rigidity, und efficiency.

<p>
    Quite a few Verbände have been excluded in the list as compared to the Kabal of the Black Heart list, as they overlap too much with the Harlequin Verbände, among these the option to make Air Sturmtrupp. The option to take Venoms has been replaced with Tantalus transports, the Ravager formation has been replaced with the very competent Reapers. The Vessel of Pain formation has been moved to the 33% section as the Partisans section became a bit too rigid otherwise. The Executioner has been replaced mit einemversion of the NetEA Tormentor Titan.
