<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The Sa'cea Tau is almost identical to the NetEA Tau original. Only a few minor tweaks has been made:
<ul>
    <li>The price of the Pathfinder Group has been reduced to 175 Punkte</li>
    <li>The price of the Broadside upgrade, available to Fire Warriors Strike Cadre, has been reduced to 125 Punkte</li>
    <li>Gun Drones have had their firefight value reduced to 6+, mainly because of their role in the Vior'la Tau list</li>
    <li>The Manta has been redesigned, in alignment mit other large Kriegsmaschinen in EA:Ragnarök. It now has 6 DC für a price of 550 Punkte</li>
</ul>
