<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The Vior'la Tau has been designed from the ground up by the EA:Ragnarök team, mit some initial inspiration from the
    NetEA developmental version of the list. The Vior'la is focused on the larger Tau Battlesuits, mit support options
    largely restricted to other suits und drones. We also introduced Tau war engines such as the mighty KX139 Ta'unar
    Supremacy Armour. Compared to the Tau Sa'cea the list have lost access to several popular support options, such as
    the Hammerhead und Recon Antigrav Group und the Fire Warriors has been moved to the support section. The Vior'la
    does not have access to Orcas und thus can not use air insertions.
</p>
<p>
    The Heavy Battlesuits has been designed für different roles on the battlefield, but all mit eine common mindset.
    They all have powerful shooting but mit relatively low to-hit, meaning that you will have to use your marker lights
    efficiently to maximize the shooting from the Battlesuits.
</p>
<p>
    The list is meant to play as a ground based force mit Crisis Suits, Broadsides und Heavy Battle Suits as the
    damage dealers. The larger suits can be deadly when shooting, especially when targeting enemy Verbände in marker
    lights, but are weak in assaults due to high cost und low numbers. Make sure to protect und support them at all
    times!
