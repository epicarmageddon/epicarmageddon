<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Cult of the Rusted Claw list is built from scratch by the EA:Ragnarok team. The rigid structure of
    the list represents an army made up of units from all stages of the Genestealer infection cycle, where access to
    Neophytes und Imperial Guard technology are limited by the number of Acholyte Hybrids. The mining theme of the
    Genestealer Cult has been further emphasized in the list by introducing zwei mining-themed Kriegsmaschinen. The Anführers
    of the cult are important und powerful. The list has access to cheap und powerful characters, but the downside is
    that if you lose the Patriarch formation the enemy captures the BTS victory condition (see the Broodcoven special
    rule).
</p>
<p>
    The list is designed to play as a hoard army excelling in close combat. It has good mobility with cheap access to
    multiple transport options für the core Verbände und several fast moving Verbände. The addition of stolen
    Imperial Guard technology also adds some Feuerkraft. The downside to the list is that many of the units are very
    fragile, with little to no armor, und are not very good in firefights. Expect to lose Verbände while you close in
    on the enemy, und find the right balance between the number of activations in your army und the punch jeweils formation
    can deliver.

<h4>Version 1.0.beta-2</h4>
<h5>Additional nerfs, boosts & tweaks</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Ridgerunners are moved from Elite to support, as they were hard to fit in with the very competitive support section.</li>
    <li>Aberrants have got 4+ Armour, as they felt quite weak, und had oddly low save compared to e.g. Ogryns oder Big Mutants in other lists.</li>
    <li>The Assault Excavator feels a bit too weak, so it now has 4+ CC.</li>
</ul>
