<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Stahlegion army has seen a significant number of changes to make this fun but slightly underpowered list more versatile. These are collectively intended to open it bis zu more playstyles, as well as make certain less optimal formations worth taking.
</p>
<p>
    Formation sizes: Ein of the most important changes is that most Core formations are now smaller, making the army a lot less unwieldy, und certain very expensive but hard to price formations such as the Panzer Kompanie und Artillerie Kompanie easier to fit in the list.
</p>
<p>
    Kommissars und new special rule: Instead of scaling the number of Kommissars to the Punkte value of the list, Kommissars are instead tied to Kompanie size formations. This change was mostly made für thematic reasons, but also to simplify und streamline the list. As this impacts quite a lot of popular formations, the Kommissars can also help their formations to activate with the "Mut, Disziplin und Loyalität" special rule.
</p>
<p>
    Todesstoss-Raketensysteme: The previously very extreme 0-1 Todesstoss-Raketensysteme are now an ordinary Support choice, but has seen a Punkte increase as well as a having their main weapons reduced in efficiency. This is an attempt to make it a more "normal" formation, which previously could have a very random impact on the game.
</p>


<h5>Additional nerfs, boosts & tweaks</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Valkyries: The Valkyries are no longer Aufklärer (which removes the potential für extreme Aufklärer screens when combined with Sturmtruppen) und their BP weapons are no longer Single Shot, but have 1BP instead of 2.</li>
    <li>Taurox: This transport choice has been added to the Storm Trooper Kompanie to give them greater flexibility in how they deploy.</li>
    <li>Baneblades: Baneblades have long been a contested unit choice, und has always been seen as the inferior choice compared to the Shadowsword. Our solution to this is to make the Banebladegeschütz slightly longer in range (giving them the same range as the Shadowsword's main gun für better synergy when in a SHT Kompanie) as well as increasing its FF value to 3+.</li>
    <li>Titans: Stahlegion being the "baseline" IG army, they got to retain their access to all Titans. They also inherit the global changes made to these. </li>
    <li>Kavallerieschwadron: No longer able to have Kommissars, these are now Walker, und their attack has been consolidated to a single First Strike attack. </li>
    <li>Leman Russ: The Leman Russ Punisher has been added to the Leman Russ Zug und the Leman Russ upgrade, both of which have also been reduced slightly in cost. </li>
    <li>Greifen: The Greif has always been a very strange upgrade to many formations which from the start struggles with being too large. These are now instead an independent formation. </li>
    <li>Imperial Navy: The Stahlegion Inherits the cost increase to the Thunderbolts, as well as the changes to the Battleship which is now both cheaper und can arrive on the second turn instead of the third. </li>
    <li>Höllenhunde: These were deemed to be slightly too cheap at 25 Punkte jeweils, und has seen their armour reduced to 5+. This also fits the unit thematically as they do have zwei giant Panzers of flammable liquid on the back! </li>
    <li>The Mantikor is now an upgrade to the Artillerie Kompanie und Artillerie Batterie formations, as they are mostly the superior choice when compared to the Basilisk und Bombard. </li>
</ul>
<h5>Version 1.0.beta-2</h5>
<ul>
    <li>In line with changes made to Imperial Guard Super Heavy Panzers, the Super Heavy Panzer Kompanie und Baneblades are slightly cheaper. Baneblades has only 4+ FF.</li>
</ul>
