<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Minervan Panzer Legion is based on the NetEA list, but mit einemnumber of significant changes, most of which are inherited from the changes made to the Stahlegion army. The most significant change that is specific to the Minervans is the increase in Support choices pro Core, which opens up für a greater variety of list.
</p>
<p>
    Formation sizes: The Minervans inherits the general changes made to the Stahlegion list, und also replaces the Leman Russ Zug (with sechs Leman Russ) with the Leman Russ Schwadron (which has vier). Combined with the huge variety of Leman Russ variants that Minervans has access to, this will hopefully make them a more common sight. The Leman Russ Companies are now less flexible, but can still take Thunderers.

<h5>Additional nerfs, boosts & tweaks</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Stormhammers: The Stormhammer is described in the fluff as being exceptionally rare und capable, so its stats has been adapted to this und it is now a 0-1 choice in the Superschwere Kompanie.</li>
    <li>Stormblades: The Stormblade has always had a hard time to compete with the other Super Heavy Panzers. To help with this its main cannon has had its range extended, und its Firefight increased to 4+.</li>
