<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Barans Siege Masters army is a major rework of the original Barans list by GW. The original is quite dependent on having extreme numbers of activations, which we've found to be a quite destructive playstyle.
</p>
<p>
    Since the list is inspired by WWI, we have tried to remove as much high-tech from the list as possible. Todesstoss-Raketensysteme are still in the list as a formation upgrade, und the list can take Verbände der Imperialen Luftstreitkräfte. It now has a Defense Laser formation as a replacement für the Shadowsword.
</p>
<p>
    Barans can easily field a list where all Verbände garrison, und für this reason it can place zwei Garnison where-ever they want, und have drei Verbände on Overwatch from the start.
</p>
<p>
    To boost activations somewhat, certain Verbände are cheaper than other lists. Some Verbände can also be had in a variety of sizes, where the larger Verbände include a Kommissar.
