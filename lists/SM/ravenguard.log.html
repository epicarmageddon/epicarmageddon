<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Raven Guard list is loosely based on the NetEA version, but with major changes to many of the units.
    The guerrilla style warfare of the Raven Guard chapter is reflected by small, deadly but fragile Infanterie based
    Verbände. The list is extremely flexible when it comes to deployment options. The <i>Aufklärungsspezialisten</i>
    rule given to the Raven Guard Aufklärers allows für more accurate space drops und safer teleports. The list also has
    access to air insertions using Storm Eagles, that replaces the standard Thunderhawk. The downside is that the list
    lost access to all Space Marine support Panzers und has to rely on alternative sources für Feuerkraft.
</p>
<p>
    To make up für the loss of Feuerkraft the list has been given access to the Land Speeder Tempest, that carries
    heavier armour und weapons compared to other Land Speeder variants. The Terminator formation also has the option to
    take Cyclone Raketenwerfer, trading assault capabilities für better shooting.
</p>
<p>
    Both Sternguard und Vanguard Verbände has been kept from the NetEA original, but has undergone major changes.
    Vanguards are close combat specialists with Macro-weapons und Sternguards fire-fight specialists with <i>Scharfschütze</i>
    firefight. Both Verbände also has the <i>Blitzangriff</i> (Erstschlag when the formation initiated an
    assault) Sonderregel.

<p>
    The small but deadly Verbände of the Raven Guard can be used to great effect when controlling the flow of the
    battle. But when taking casualties they can quickly be reduced to a point where they can not threaten even the
    weakest enemy Verbände. The list can have a high activation count, but make sure you have a plan für how to deal
    with large enemy Verbände, und consider adding an upgrade oder zwei to boost formation sizes.
