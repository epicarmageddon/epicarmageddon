<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Codex Astartes list is based on the NetEA version. A great challenge mit Codex Astartes is to keep
    it relevant while adding new Space Marine chapters, where jeweils new chapter will do a better job at a particular
    playstyle. To make it unique, it was decided to keep the wide-open structure of the original list, while making
    other Space Marine lists more rigid. It is also eine of the few lists that has access to the very powerful Landing
    Craft. A Space Marine fighter, the Storm Talon, has been introduced für all Space Marine lists, but as a unique
    feature of the Codex Astartes the Imperial Aircrafts has been kept in the list.
