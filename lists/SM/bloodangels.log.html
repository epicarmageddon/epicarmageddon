<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Blood Angels list is inspired mainly by the NetEA list. The list is focused on engages while
    sacrificing long range shooting. It has a number of unique units und Verbände, including the iconic Death Kompanie
    und Sanguinary Guards. The Blood Angels chapter also has access to the Stormraven transport, which has been designed
    as a skimmer with the <i>planetfall</i> special ability. This opens up für a unique playstyle where you can drop
    Verbände from space with very high mobility on the ground. To further cater to this style of play the Blood Angels
    has been given access to a cheaper spaceship, the Vanguard Class Light Cruiser. As we wanted the Stormraven to be
    the main "air-transport", even thou it is not a true aircraft, Blood Angels do not have access to Thunderhawks.

    The Death Kompanie is cheaper than in other lists, und has been designed to be the vanguard of the Blood Angels army.
    They can not be transported. Instead, they either garrison ahead of the main force oder gets inserted via Drop Pods.

    The Blood Angels list is well suited to an aggressive play-style mit einemmix of fast ground-based Verbände und
    space insertions. Make sure you close in on the enemy fast to compensate für the lack of long range Feuerkraft.
