<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök White Scars list is based on the NetEA/EpicUK original mit einemnumber of organizational und formation
    changes to differentiate the list further from the Codex Astartes. First of all a Kern/Support split has been
    introduced (as in all marine chapter lists).  The transport restrictions in the NetEA/EpicUK lists has been lifted so that jeweils formation
    is free to choose deployment option.
</p>
<p>
    We wanted more focus on bikes in the White Scars list, so the 8-unit Bike Verbände were made Kern, und regular
    Aufklärer Verbände were replaced by Aufklärer Bikes. The White Scars Bikes und Land Speeders has also been given zwei
    unique Sonderregels to represent the extreme speed of the White Scars. The Bikes can consolidate longer, und Attack
    Bikes und Land Speeders can shoot better at full speed.
</p>
<p>In addition:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Terminator formation was given Land Raider Crusaders as the default transport option. This reduces the size und prize of the formation, making it less extreme.</li>
    <li>The Vindicator variant without dozer blades (from the NetEA list) were kept und also made available in a unique formation of their own.</li>
</ul>
