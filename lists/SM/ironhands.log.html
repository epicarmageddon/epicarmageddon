<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Iron Hands list is built by the EA:Ragnarok team with inspiration from the developmental NetEA list.
    The list has a strong focus on mechanized Infanterie, armored vehicles und Cybots und has access to many
    unique Cybot und Land Raider configurations. The list is designed für a ground based play style but also has
    some Verbände that works well when deployed from space. The list also has access to Thunderhawk Transporters as a
    way to air transport the mechanized Infanterie oder armoured Verbände.

<p>
    Since the Iron Hands chapter has strong ties to the Adeptus Mechanicus the list has been given access to more
    flexible weapons configuration on their Titans. The list has access to a Techmarine character with unique abilities
    to "repair" armoured vehicles, und the list also has a unique Devastoren using powerful (but short ranged) Graviton
    Guns.

<p>
    In general, most Iron Hands Verbände are powerful but expensive. Do not expect to have a high number of
    activations und do not try to do everything at the same time. Including both space drops, titans und air transports
    will almost certainly spread your focus too thin...
