<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Imperial Fists list is based on the NetEA version. We consider the Imperial Fist to be a very strong
    list in NetEA und have restricted oder redesigned several of the units und Verbände. In general, playing against
    Verbände with They Shall Know No Fear sitting in fortified positions with access to good long ranged Feuerkraft can
    be a bit frustrating. In an attempt to address this issue the Sonderregels für Imperial Fists units in fortified
    positions has been removed, und units like the Bastion has been redesigned. The list has, like all other Space
    Marine chapter lists, received a core/support section to stear the list in the direction of the Siege theme.

<p>
    The Imperial Fists are siege specialists und the list has access to specialized siege equipment. Many Verbände in
    the list can trade mobility (Rhinos) für extra Feuerkraft. A challenge when playing Imperial Fists is to find a good
    balance between defensive Feuerkraft und Verbände that can attack the enemy, take their Blitz oder destroy their BTS
    formation und win you the game.
