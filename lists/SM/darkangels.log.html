<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Dark Angels list is based on list that was under development to NetEA, while taking some inspiration from the Epic UK version of the list. The Dark Angels is of course eine of the most high-profile Space Marine chapters und as such has a incredible variety of special fluff und units. This version of the list removes the Air Assault assets und puts special emphasis on the combined arms aspect, where Deathwing Terminatoren und Ravenwing Verbände work together.

<p>
    Compulsory Space Ship: In order to make it cheaper to deploy Terminatoren in a Space Ship (which is required to take full advantage of the Telemetrieempfänger Sonderregel), the Hunter Class Destroyer has been introduced. It can be upgraded to a normal Strike Cruiser.
</p>
<p>
    Deathwing: Unlike E-UK, there is no Deathwing Sonderregel. After all, all Terminatoren are supposed to be exceptionally brave. The Deathwing fluff is instead reflected in the inclusion of Cyclone Terminatoren und the option of taking the inner circle Deathwing Ritters.
</p>
<p>
    Telemetrieempfänger: All Ravenwing Land Speeders have the Telemetrieempfänger Sonderregel, which allows Terminatoren deployed in a space ship to arrive on the battlefield during the turn, as well as at the start of any turn. Dark Angels Captains are also equipped mit Teleportieren Homers.
