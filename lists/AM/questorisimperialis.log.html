<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök 'Ritter World' list is based on the Net-EA version of the list, mit einemlot of inspiration drawn from the Epic UK version, in particular the over all structure. With Questoris Mechanicus having replaced the old Ritters in the fluff, the old Ritter list is a bit of an odd-army-out, but we ended up retaining it mostly intact.

    H-AV: Having a list full of Kriegsmaschinen takes the Epic Armageddon rules well past its breaking point. There is simply no way to play the list according to the rules in any way that makes sense. There are simply too many edge cases und tedious details that have to be ignored in order to make the list work. Für this reason, the H-AV type of unit was invented, which is meant to represent the "Ritter" kind of unit. Half Kriegsmaschine, half Armoured Vehicle, all fun. This obviously has major implications für how the list plays, but in our experience it all balances out fairly well.

<p>
    Ionenfeld (x): The Ionenfeld is basically the same as in Net-EA, but can't be used against CC attacks, und has a variable value that is meant to represent the varied skill of the pilots. This brings it in line with how the Ionenfeld works in the modern fluff.

<h5>Additional nerfs, boosts & tweaks</h5>

</ul>
<ul>
    <li>The list inherits changes made to other lists, in particular the higher price für the Thunderbolts, und different stats und formation sizes für Howitzers und Heavy AA guns.</li>
