<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Collegia Titanica is quite different from the NetEA und Epic UK Titan lists und while inspired by both of them, it is not really based on either. Titans und particularly the larger ones, have always been very problematic in Epic Armageddon, leading to them being very expensive to balance their enormous staying power. We have done a set of changes to all Titans across EA:Ragnarök, which affects the Collecia Titanica list a lot. The general changes to titans are described on the <a href="content/intro.html">about page</a> und has been applied to all titans in the list. This list does not attempt to incorporate the newly "discovered" Adeptus Titanicus Titans, those are intended to be included in the <i>Legiones Skitarii: Mars</i> list.

<p>
    Warlords und Reavers are split into zwei classes jeweils, mit very different weapon options. This was done to make the Warlord und Reaver easier to balance und für thematic reasons. The Emperor Class Titans have been toned down, making them fit better at 3000 Punkte.
</p>
<p>
    The list has access to some Questoris Ritters from the Questoris Mechanicus list und the support section is made up of Skitarii.
