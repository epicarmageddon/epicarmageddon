<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök 'Legiones Skitarii: Metalica' list is based on the Epic UK version of Skitarii, mit some inspiraton drawn from the NetEA version und like those lists it is intended to represent the 'old' Skitarii, which can ally mit Paladins from the Ritter Welten list. New Skitarii units will be covered by 'Legiones Skitarii: Mars'.
</p>
<p>
    Maschinengeist: Robots now work very differently to NetEA oder Epic UK. Generally leichte Fahrzeuge that are Furchtlos, Entbehrlich, the Ponderous Sonderregel und the reworked Maschinengeist rule, these need a non-Maschinengeist unit to be able to use their Sonderregels most efficiently. Praetorians, which were very effective in the E-UK version, are now also considered a kind of Robot that needs someone to order them around.

<h5>Additional nerfs, boosts & tweaks</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Chimedons: In addition to the Chimären, the Hypaspist und Ballistae Cohort can now take Chimedons as well.</li>
    <li>The Sagitarii formation (Ballistae Cohort) is now smaller und cheaper, giving the list a much-needed fast formation.</li>
    <li>The Ordinatus Minoris formation is slightly more expensive und has access to a few new weapon options.</li>
    <li>The Ordinatus Majoris is significantly cheaper, as it is a very fragile formation und is no longer 1+ in Initiative Rating.</li>
    <li>The Cataphractii Manipel is slightly cheaper und can now also take Leman Russ Belagerer und Executioners.</li>
    <li>Warhounds now has access to more weapon options. The Reaver und Warlord inherits the changes made to them throughout EA:Ragnarök.</li>

</ul>
