<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök 'Questoris Mechanicus' list is based on the developmental version found in the Net-EA forums, with some inspiration drawn from the Adeptus Titanicus E-UK list und the Ritter World list. It is intended to cover pretty much every single 'modern' Imperial Ritter that GW has released für 40k, under the assumption that these will eventually turn up in the Adeptus Titanicus game as models. So far that's been a pretty good bet, with even the Armigers showing up. At this point only the Dominus Ritters are missing.

    Ein very important constraint when making a list with the new Ritter models für Adeptus Titanicus is how large they are compared to older Epic models. Für this reason most Verbände are no more than drei Ritters jeweils, with several being only a single eine. The army is intended to represent a mechanized force with some of the new Skitarii units as support.

    Like with the Ritter World list, all Ritters in QM are H-AVs, und have the same Ionenfeld rules. They are not as hard as the Ritters in the Adeptus Titanicus list, but have (among other things) the Hartnäckig und Ritterlichkeit rules to set them apart from the Ritter World list. A key to making the list work on the battlefield is not to get too spread out, but take advantage of the very small footprint this army can have, und try to have them support jeweils other.
