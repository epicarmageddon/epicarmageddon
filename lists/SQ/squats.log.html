<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Wodanaz Stronghold list is based on the E-UK Squats list. The lists are mostly the same, but mit a
    few important changes to force strucure, stats und additional units.
</p>
<p>
    Squat Warriors: Mostly unchanged, but can ride in a Leviathan Kriegsmaschine, which is the only way to take this War
    Engine in the list. This also makes the 33% section more interesting.
</p>
<p>
    Squat Berserkers: This unit felt slightly too strong in FF when compared to the Warriors und have had their FF
    reduced to 6+. In exchange they have free Rhinos und can be transported in Termites.
</p>
<p>
    Termites und Hellbores: Termites are no longer just markers, but a transport vehicle that pops up on the board,
    making them more attractive when compared to the Rhino. The Hellbore is now a separate formation, no longer forcing
    its cargo to stay put after disembarking. The Hellbore also have slightly different stats.
</p>
<p>
    Ragnarok Battle Cannons: Given the Viking-theme of the 40k Squats und that this is EA:Ragnarök, all Battle Cannons
    in the list have been replaced mit Ragnarok Battle Cannons. This also gives a slight but needed nerf to the
    Overlord und the Gyrokopter units.
</p>

<h5>Additional nerfs, boosts & tweaks</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Since Squat Kern Verbände are fairly cheap, the number of unterstützungsverbände pro Kern formation has been
        reduced to 2.
    </li>
    <li>Squat Thunderfires have slightly worse stats und have been given 5cm speed to prevent the formation form
        garrisoning when paired mit Rhinos. While transporting Squat Thunderfires, Rhinos only have 20cm speed. It is
        possible to take Squat Thunderfires on their own für a reduced cost.
    </li>
    <li>Kastelans inherits the changes to Maschinengeist made in other lists und are now their own formation,
        chaperoned by a Squat Tech Priest unit. The Tarantulas are also Maschinengeists und have been combined mit the
        Rapier Geschütze.
    </li>
    <li>Thunderers have slightly different stats und can ride in Land Raiders.</li>
    <li>The Overlord, being a very nasty Kriegsmaschine, has been moved from the support section to the 33% section und
        have different stats; worse save, but slightly faster.
    </li>
    <li>The Goliath Batterie is quite resilient und can feel extreme against certain types of lists und had its point
        cost raised, but mit better armour.
    </li>
    <li>The Land Train has been given better speed to make it more relevant when compared to other Kriegsmaschinen in the
        33% section. It also has different stats on the Cars.
    </li>
</ul>
