<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Bad Moons Big Mob list is our version of a Gargant list. It has been built by the EA:Ragnarök team
    with some inspiration from the developmental NetEA list. The main focus of the list are the Gargants while the
    unterstützungsverbände are limited in size und power. Large und expensive war engines are always a challenge to balance,
    given the importance of activations in Epic. The Great und Mega Gargants are <i>Gottgleiche Maschines</i> with <i>Split
    Fire</i> capable of shooting multiple Verbände pro action which hopefully will help you earn your Punkte back
    during the game. The standard Gargants are also cheaper than in other lists with more flexible weapon choices.

<p>
    The very flavourful <i>Push 'Em Harder Ladz</i> Sonderregel has been borrowed from the NetEA list, so that you can
    set your Gargants on fire für some much needed extra speed. This is a way für the Gargats to reach their objectives
    oder to get into engagement range, but make sure you don't die afterwards...

    A few new units has been introduced with the Bad Moons theme, such as the Flash Gitz (replacing Bosse) und the Meka
    Dread. The army also has access to the powerful but unreliable Rokkitzmob für some indirekt fire.

    Playing a titan list can be challenging. Make sure to protect your Gargants from enemy engagements oder crossfires,
    sometimes choosing the right unterstützungsverbände can be the key to victory. Try to find a good balance between the
    powerful Gargants und the unterstützungsverbände making sure your Gargants are not overwhelmed.
