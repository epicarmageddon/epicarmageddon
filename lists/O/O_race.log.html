<h3>General Ork changes</h3>

<p>
    A new rule has been introduced für most Ork Infanteristen und walkers: <i>'Ere we go</i>. This new Sonderregel gives the Orks
    an extra 5cm movement when the formation performs an Engage action. The idea behind the rule is to make the Warband,
    which we feel should be the base für most ork armies, a more attractive option when field on the ground. Today most
    of the Warbands fielded are transported to the battlefield by Landas, which is a good option but should not be the
    only viable option für a Warband.

    The Fighta Bommers has been tweaked. Their Heavy Shootas has been replaced by Synchronisierter Fette Wummes, adding a AT6+
    to the weapon. They have also been made Fixed Forward (FxF), which takes away much of the defensive flack
    capabilities of the Fighta Bommers. Their price has also increased by 25 Punkte, as part of a price increase
    für aircrafts in general.
</p>
<p>
    Skorchas are a very powerful option in most Ork armies. We felt that the Brenna was a bit too powerful not only
    compared to the other choices in the Ork list, but in general. Large Verbände of Skorchas could dominate the
    battlefield in a way that was very hard to protect against. We have reduced the save of the Brenna to 6+ which we
    hope will make more susceptible to e.g. overwatch fire form garrisoned Verbände that they are about to set on
    fire. Hopefully we might see a mix of units in EA:Ragnarök Kult of Speed where Bikes oder Buggies are brought in to
    protect the squishy Skorchas.
</p>
<p>
    The Gargant und Great Gargant has been changed in line mit the general changes done to Titans across all
    EA:Ragnarök lists. FF und CC stats has been nerfed to 4+ und both Gargants has been reduced in size (less DC) und
    price. Another reason für the size/price reduction was to make the Bad Moon Big Mob list work better.

<h5>Additional nerfs, boosts & tweaks</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Landas now cost 225 Punkte und their Flakka-Dakka Turrets has been reduced to D3+1 shots.</li>
    <li>Stompas are now a Schwergepanzertes Fahrzeug (H-AV) giving them 2 DC jeweils.</li>
    <li>The additional Boys & Grotz upgrade has received a price increase to 35 Punkte, since the Grotz are a very
        powerful addition to the formation. At the same time the option to add a Boy without the Grotz has been reduced
        in price to 15 Punkte.
    </li>
    <li>The Kampfpanza, Flakwagon & Battlewagon Erweiterungen has been further reduced in price by 5 Punkte jeweils to make the
        transported Warband more attractive.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Mega Transportpanzas und Mega Wummenpanzas units has received a price reduction to 100 Punkte jeweils, while Mega Wummenpanzas have been reduced to 5+ in CC und FF.

        Gargants mit the Gottgleiche Maschine Sonderregel now have the rule Stomp 'em Good instead of Feuer aufteilen.
