<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Snakebite Clan Ork list is the EA:Ragnarök version of a Wild Ork list. We felt the existing Wild
    Orks lists were a bit eine-sided und frustrating to play against, mit einem overload of large 4+ reinforced armor War
    Engines. We have done major changes compared to the Wild Ork list, while trying to keep the army theme intact und
    your existing models relevant.
</p>
<p>
    The Ork Infanterie has been changed für the Snakebite list into primitive versions of their more advanced brothers,
    with less advanced weaponry. A new transport has been introduced, the Gargantuan Squiggoth which is in between the
    Squiggoth und the Orkeosaurus in size. The Orkeosaurus has received a significant reduction to its armor, but is now
    faster. The Squiggoths also received the <i>'Ere we go</i> Sonderregel für another 5cm extra movement during an
    assault. We want the Warbands to get into the fray faster, while at the same time not having an indestructible ride
    to hide in while they get there.
</p>
<p>
    The Steam Gargants has been changed a lot, und is no longer 0-1. They lost their anti-air attack und their
    very frustrating critical hit effect. They now use the standard critical effect für Ork Gargants; they catch fire.
    They use a shorter range version of the Mega Kanonä und you can take a maximum of zwei Steam Gargants in a formation. We
    hope this will make the Steam Gargants more fun to play, less frustrating to face. You might also have to look für
    another formation to be your BTS, which was not the case in the Wild Ork list...
</p>
<p>
    A few new units has been introduced to give the list access to some shooting, like the Lobbas und the Squiggoth
    Supa-Lobba. Both units have indirekt fire weapons which can be powerful, but require you to take a sustained fire
    action which is a challenge für the Orks.
</p>
<p>
    The Wyrdboy character has a slightly different function in the list. It is cheaper, but has shorter range. It also cannot be placed on Kriegsmaschinen, but must be allocated to an INF unit.
</p>
<h4>Version 1.0.beta-2</h4>
<p>
    Finding the list a bit too weak, we've introduced the following buffs to the list:
</p>
<p>
    The Brutes, which replace the Bosse, has gained the powerful "Rush 'em Ladz" special rule in exchange für their previous Befehlshaber special rule. This gives their formation a +1 bonus when attempting to take March actions, somewhat compensating für the army's slow speed when compared to other Ork lists. This made Junkatrukks slightly more expensive. A powerful choice even before, as it is the fastest formation, it is even better now as it has a Brute.
</p>
<p>
    The Gargantuan Squiggoth gained einen zusätzlichen MW attack in CC, einen zusätzlichen DC, und both it und the Orkeosaurus now have 3+ in CC.
