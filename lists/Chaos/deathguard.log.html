<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Death Guard has taken some inspiration from the E-UK version of the list, as well as the Emperor's Children Net-EA list. Instead of the Unmodifizierter Rettungswurf und lack of access to the 'March' action, the list trades improved armour für slower speed on some of its units.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Faction Specific Terminatoren</b>: Most CSM armies now have Terminatoren with special specific stats und weaponry, while those of The 'Cult' armies are also Furchtlos. This of course comes mit einemsignificant increase in cost. Like other 'Cult' armies, Terminatoren are now in the Core section instead of Elite, given their high cost.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Daemons</b>: All 'Cult' CSM armies now has a free Greater Daemon point, as well as having a compulsory Dämonischer Pakt upgrade. This both gives them more personality und tighter relationship with their respective patron god, but also creates some interesting tensions in army building (the Greater Daemon might be free, but the Chaos Champion certainly isn't...). This also compensates the Cult lists für the lost flexibility in daemons that Black Legion now has. What the Cult CSM lists do have is access to better version of the Daemonic Beast, as well as high-end lesser daemons which costs 2 summoning Punkte to put on the battlefield, which opens up the potential für extremely powerful Verbände if summoning over a few turns.
</p>
<h5>Additional nerfs, boosts & tweaks</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Death Guards trades the normal CSM fliers und space ships für Heldrakes, Harbringer Bombers und the Plagueship.</li>
    <li>Plague Zombies are fixed size, but slightly worse stats.</li>
    <li>Plague Tower oriented more towards being a transport option, with higher speed und worse save.</li>
    <li>Nurgle Titans trades Deflektorschilde für more DC, retains the same speed as others of their type. The Warlord equivalent has been removed, und is instead reserved für the Traitor Titan Legion list.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Version 1.0.beta-2</h4>
<p>
    After receiving feedback from the community we have reviewed the Death Guard list to further emphasize their combat doctrine und to correct some power imbalances in the list. We want the Death Guard to be a slow moving force of relentless Infanterie, backed up by powerful daemon engines using toxic weaponry to destroy their enemies. Some of that play style got lost in the first beta version, so we have done the following changes. The Retinue has received a price drop to 300 Punkte. We have replaced the Auserwählte formation with Havocs in the elite section, to reduce the Aufklärering abilities of the list. We also replaced the Land Raiders mit einemslower Death Guard variant und removed the Chaos Spartan Assault Panzer.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Daemon Engines</b>: All Nurgle daemon engines have replaced their <i>Unmodifizierter Rettungswurf</i> with <i>regeneration</i> as we feel it fits the army theme und some of them needed a boost. We also wanted to give jeweils of them a more defined role in the list, as they were all quite similar.
    <ul>
        <li>The Plague Tower has been changed into a pure transport upgrade für the core Verbände. It is also slightly smaller but now cost only 150 Punkte.</li>
        <li>The Desecrators have been changed back closer to their UK original, mit einemPlague Geschütz as a main gun but with nerfed range.</li>
        <li>The price of the Plague Reaper has been reduced to 200 Punkte.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    There was a lot of debate regarding the Plague Zombies. In the first beta we nerfed them significantly compared to the Epic UK original, as we felt they could be used in very destructive ways. The main problem, und what makes them so hard to price, is the fact that they are Furchtlos. In the beta-2 version we have renamed the unit Poxwalkers, removed the <i>Furchtlos</i> Sonderregel but made the formation much cheaper at 125 Punkte.
</p>
<h4>Version 1.0.beta-3</h4>
<p>
    With some more games played, we've found the list a smidge too strong. Für this reason the Death Guard Retinue has been made 25pts more expensive, und the Blight Drones have the Jump Pack Sonderregel instead of being Antigrav.
</p>
<h4>Version 1.0.beta-4</h4>
<p>
    The Beast des Nurgle unit has seen some changes to make it more attractive compared to the other Nurgle lesser daemons.
