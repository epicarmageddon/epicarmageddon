<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Emperor's Children list is based on the NetEA version, mit some elements borrowed from the E-UK version as well.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Compulsory Cult Marines</b>: In the NetEA version of the Emperor's Children, it was perfectly possible to play without any Noise Marines whatsoever, while the E-UK version enStreitmächte a great deal of Noise Marines, making the list quite expensive. The EA:Ragnarök versions of the CSM Cult armies tries to land in between these extremes mit the Kern retinues being roughtly split between Furchtlos und non-Furchtlos units.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Faction Specific Terminatoren</b>: Most CSM armies now have Terminatoren mit special specific stats und weaponry, while those of The 'Cult' armies are also Furchtlos. This of course comes mit einemsignificant increase in cost. Like other 'Cult' armies, Terminatoren are now in the Kern section instead of Elite, given their high cost.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Characters</b>: No more Hexer Lord, but the Lord und Warlord characters now have different equipment oriented towards Erstschlag und all have the Dämonischer Fokus Sonderregel. This makes it cheaper to use daemons as semi-permanent additions to Verbände.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Daemons</b>: All 'Cult' CSM armies now has a free Greater Daemon point, as well as having a compulsory Dämonischer Pakt upgrade. This both gives them more personality und tighter relationship mit their respective patron god, but also creates some interesting tensions in army building (the Greater Daemon might be free, but the Chaos Champion certainly isn't...). This also compensates the Cult lists für the lost flexibility in daemons that Black Legion now has. What the Cult CSM lists do have is access to better version of the Daemonic Beast, as well as high-end lesser daemons which costs 2 Beschwörung Punkte to put on the battlefield, which opens up the potential für extremely powerful Verbände if Beschwörung over a few turns.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Thunderhawk</b>: The Chaos Thunderhawk is gone, partly because it has many other unique unit types to choose from und partly as it was a better fit für a future CSM list, the Night Lords. As a slight compensation the Despoiler Class Battleship has been added to the list.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Daemonic Ritters</b>: These Verbände are no longer 0-1, but are on the other hand fixed in formation size which makes it impossible to create the "death star", BTS Verbände of Daemonic Ritters that felt a bit too obvious in the NetEA version. The stats of the Hell-Ritter has been boosted to bring it to par mit the Hell-Scourges. These are also no longer Kriegsmaschinen, but are intead of the new unit type H-AV, making them significantly easier to engage. The Hell-Strider has slightly different stats.
</p>
