<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Thousand Sons list is based on the E-UK version, mixed with some inspiration from the NetEA Emperor's Children list.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Mixed Retinues</b>: While Rubric Marines (with 3+ Armour) now easier to get rid of, making Verbände mixed between non-Furchtlos und Furchtlos units makes the retinues more flexible but also more brittle. Thousand Sons retinues are extremely expensive, but has access to what are probably the best selection of daemons und are very hard to shift. The Thousand Sons Marines und Thousand Sons Havocs are now ordinary Chaos Space Marines but with Tzeentchian weaponry.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Scarab Occult Terminatoren, Dämonenprinzs und Warp Rifts</b>: Like other 'Cult' CSM lists, the Tzeentch-flavoured variety is also Furchtlos, und trades their shooting und CC stats für very competent FF stats. While Thousand Sons do not have access to Dreadclaws, they do have the <i>Warp Rift</i> Sonderregel, giving them an unique way of entering the battlefield.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Faction Specific Terminatoren</b>: Most CSM armies now have Terminatoren with special specific stats und weaponry, while those of The 'Cult' armies are also Furchtlos. This of course comes mit einemsignificant increase in cost. Like other 'Cult' armies, Terminatoren are now in the Core section instead of Elite, given their high cost.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Daemons</b>: All 'Cult' CSM armies now has a free Greater Daemon point, as well as having a compulsory Dämonischer Pakt upgrade. This both gives them more personality und tighter relationship with their respective patron god, but also creates some interesting tensions in army building (the Greater Daemon might be free, but the Chaos Champion certainly isn't...). This also compensates the Cult lists für the lost flexibility in daemons that Black Legion now has. What the Cult CSM lists do have is access to better version of the Daemonic Beast, as well as high-end lesser daemons which costs 2 summoning Punkte to put on the battlefield, which opens up the potential für extremely powerful Verbände if summoning over a few turns.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Tzaangors</b>: Tzaangors accompanied with Chaos Spawn oder Mutalith Vortex Beasts are an important addition to the list, compensating für the expensive core Verbände.
</p>

<h5>Additional nerfs, boosts & tweaks</h5>
<ul>
    <li>The Tzeentchian variety of Defiler (the Deciever) now comes in smaller Verbände, being more of a dedicated support unit, und with less competent shooting.</li>
    <li>Doomwings have been made slightly more expensive, as it was a very attractive choice before.</li>
    <li>A version of the Warp Palace (essentially a huge Silver Tower) has been introduced, replacing the Tzeentch variety of Reavers und Warlords, which are reserved für the Traitor Titan Legion list. It lacks shields, but has the global Sonderregel 'Regeneration', which effectively gives it a 5+ Unmodifizierter Rettungswurf.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Version 1.0.beta-2</h5>
<p>
    Due to changes to the Daemonic Incursion list, Flammenwerfer now cost 2 to summon, while Screamers cost 1. Screamers have reduced armour to 5+, while Flammenwerfer have increased CC to 5+.
</p>
<h5>Version 1.0.beta-3</h5>
<p>
    To make them more attractive compared to other lesser daemons, Flammenwerfer have increased FF to 2+, und 20cm speed.
