<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök World Eaters list is mainly based on the E-UK version, but has no access to Titans, instead
    orienting it towards the great selection des Khorne Daemon engines that exists in 40k.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Split Retinues</b>: In the E-UK version of the list, the basic retinue could be very powerful if many Verbände were taken, as Khorne Berserker were comparatively cheap für their size, und very hard to get rid of since the entire formation was Furchtlos. The introduction Chaos Assault Marines retains the very aggressive playstyle of these Verbände while making them more vulnerable to losing Engages und giving retinues some shooting.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Faction Specific Terminatoren</b>: Most CSM armies now have Terminatoren with special specific stats und weaponry, while those of The 'Cult' armies are also Furchtlos. This of course comes mit einemsignificant increase in cost. Like other 'Cult' armies, Terminatoren are now in the Core section instead of Elite, given their high cost.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Juggernauts und Bloodcrushers</b>: In order to make a greater difference between Juggernauts und Bikes, und to enable the introduction of Bloodcrushers, Juggernaut riders now have better armour, better speed but no infiltrate, these Verbände must now get closer to the enemy than before. Bloodcrushers gives the list access to exceptionally hard Daemons that can keep pace with other Juggernauts. These changes were also made to enable the Daemonic Incursion list to work better.
