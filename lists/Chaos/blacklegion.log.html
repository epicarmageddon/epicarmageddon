<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Black Legion list is based on the NetEA version. Black Legion is eine of the most powerful armies in Epic Armageddon, und it still is, but the changes will hopefully open it bis zu more playstyles. Below are the more significant changes.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Anti-Air</b>: Black Legion previously only had Kyborgs as their sole ground AA unit, which by its nature caused certain formations to very common. To open up the playstyle a bit the Chaos Stalker has been added to most CSM armies, while Kyborgs can be taken as part of the Chaos Terminatoren formation.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Factions</b>: All factions except Undivied have been removed from the list, but due to the more balanced lesser daemons, they now cost 1 point to summon.
</p>
<h5>Additional nerfs, boosts & tweaks</h5>
<ul>

    <li>Black Legion Characters can only join Chaos Space Marines, Havocs, Raptors, Chaos Assault Bikes, oder Chaos Terminatoren units.</li>
    <li>The Havocs und Cult Marines Erweiterungen do no longer add to formation size by replacing CSM units. This makes the Erweiterungen more attractive by making them significantly cheaper.</li>
    <li>The Armoured Kompanie has been moved to the Support Section.</li>
    <li>Chosen are now forced to take Rhinos, but can replace these with Chaos Cybots. </li>
    <li>The Harbringer has been removed from the list.</li>
    <li>The Vernichter has had its FF value reduced to 5+.</li>
    <li>The Doom Wheel is in most ways better than a Chaos Warhound, und is therefore 25 Punkte more expensive.</li>
    <li>The Chaos Warhounds have been reduced to 25cm speed, in line with other Warhound type units in the game.</li>
    <li>The Chaos Reaver und Warlord replaces the Khorne-type Titans that Black Legion had, but have essentially the same weapons. They inherit the type of changes that has been made to titans elsewhere in the game.</li>

</ul>
