<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Iron Warriors list is loosely based on the E-UK version. Iron Warriors is eine of the few Chaos Space Marine armies that lacks daemons und Chaos Sorcerers, und so start out inherently weaker than other lists. The challenge is compensate für this lack without creating builds that are too powerful. Overall, the idea is to enable a very Feuerkraft heavy playstyle with plenty of unique units und formations.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Bionics und Notreparaturen</b>: The same special rules as the loyalist Iron Hands have been introduced to the list, making certain units und formations a bit tougher.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Kyborgs</b>: Iron Warriors has special access to Kyborgs. While they cannot be taken as a separate formation, several formations in the army have access to them, in particular the Iron Warriors Retinue und the Tyrant Terminatoren.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Ordinatus</b>: The Ordinatus Majoris has tweaked stats und is significantly cheaper, as it is severly overpriced in other lists given how fragile the unit is. The list also receives the Ordinatus Minoris in chaos format. The Siegelord und Ravager Titans has been removed from the list due to these inclusions.
</p>
<h5>Additional nerfs, boosts & tweaks</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Defilers are part of the 33% section, along with the newly introduced Maulerfiends.</li>
    <li>Predators und Land Raiders can be taken along with Vindicators in the core section.</li>
    <li>Tyrant Terminatoren with Cyclone Raketenwerfer replaces Chaos Terminatoren.</li>
    <li>Siege Rhinos are introduced as an alternative to normal Chaos Rhinos. </li>
    <li>Havocs are part of the Core formations, but are forced to have Land Raiders. They can also be taken as a cheap upgrade to the Retinues.</li>
    <li>Zwei Bezashk formations have been introduced, to represent the Iron Warrior's willingness to use more extreme types of munitions.</li>
    <li>The Iron Warriors Basilisken have been raised in cost, but now has the option to be taken in a formation of drei.</li>
    <li>Hell Talons und Hell Blades have been replaced with the Heldrake formation, since the list also has the cheaper und slightly more fragile Harbringer Bomber.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Version 1.0.beta-2</h4>
<p>
    <b>Stormsword</b>: In line with the changes made to Imperial Guard Super Heavies, the Stormsword has less range on its Siege Geschütz, und is slightly cheaper.
