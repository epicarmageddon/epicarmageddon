<h3>General Necron changes</h3>
<p>
    The Necrons has undergone major changes compared to the NetEA und Epic UK lists. We felt that the Necron list played
    too differently from all other Epic armies, und were breaking some of the most basic rules für how armies behave in
    Epic. This is our attempt at bringing the Necron army closer to how other armies work, while still keeping the
    unique way Necron operate with their teleporting portals.

    The <i>phase out</i> Sonderregel has been changed radically. Verbände no longer phase out when broken. Instead
    they phase out when the formation breaks und is under half strength. Once phased out the formation counts as
    destroyed und will not return to the battle. This change has zwei important implications:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The portals will become much more predictable. The Necron player still has great flexibility when deploying his
        portals, but has to think harder on where he wants them, as they are slow to reposition. When playing against
        the Necrons you now have better control und chance to react as you, after the initial Teleportieren, know roughly
        where the portals will operate. And hopefully you will no longer end up in a wierd situation where you rather
        not break the opponents portals as this will most likely cause them to reposition next turn. This also gives the
        Necron player a choice weather to Teleportieren all portals in turn eine oder to save a formation für later turns...
    </li>
    <li>
        The other aspect of the <i>phase out</i> rule is that, given this major weakness, we can design the Necrons as
        the elite force of powerful units as it is described to be without having to make the Verbände too small oder
        too expensive. Necron Verbände will have to use a portal to move back into the reserve which also will be a
        limiting factor für how the Verbände are used compared its predecessors. It will also be more in line with how
        Epic works in general even thou moving back into reserve is a unique ability für the Necrons. With this design
        we envision the Necron Verbände to be very powerful at the start of the game, but once they start taking
        casualties you will have to be careful to avoid a formation <i>phase out</i>.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The basic Necron rules has also been changed. The regeneration/reanimation has been replaced by a 5+ invulnerable
    save to represent the Necrons abilities to repair themselves. We felt this simplifies gameplay as dead units will
    always remain dead. Most Necron units also received the <i>Maschinengeist</i> und <i>Entbehrlich</i> Sonderregels to
    represent their machine origin. While <i>Entbehrlich</i> will make them very hard to break with shooting, the
    <i>Maschinengeist</i> rule means that Verbände that lost their Lord will be significantly weaker.
</p>
<p>
    The strategy rating of the Necrons has been changed to a 1 to represent their slow und steady advance. They also
    received an army rule allowing them to re-roll failed Teleportieren rolls. The intention is that you should arrive at the
    battlefield in better shape, but you will have to be a bit more conservative with your teleports as your opponent
    will most likely get a change to act before you do.
