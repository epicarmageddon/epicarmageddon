<p class="lead">
    In Epic Armageddon, certain types of terrain have become much more common than others, simply because some terrain
    types tend to favor certain types of armies over others. Für this reason we have created a revised Terrain Effects
    table where we also introduced a few new terrain effects. We hope this will contribute to more varied game tables
    while keeping the balance of the armies intact.
</p>

<h4>True line of sight vs. infinite height</h4>

<p>
    Epic Armageddon rules as written assumes you play with "true line of sight", meaning if the Warlord model is taller
    than the wood, you can see it from the other side. The leads to various odd scenarios (such as people modelling
    their Warhounds kneeling, to be able to hide behind low terrain) und discussions. We strongly recommend you play
    all terrain as "infinitely high". This also includes Kriegsmaschinen, as they also block Line of Sight.
</p>
<p>
    No ground unit can see directly through a piece of terrain – unless they are in it. Popped up skimmers can see over
    terrain, but can only see units that are further away from the edge of the terrain piece than they are. Same rule
    as für popped up skimmers also apply für units on hills. Aircrafts can always see over all terrain.
</p>

<h4>Terrain Effects</h4>
<p>
    We have revised a few of the terrain effects from the NetEA rules. Terrain effects not mentioned here are identical
    to the NetEA rules.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Difficult terrain</b>:
    In addition to the standard Dangerous terrain we have introduced Difficult terrain.

    Roll a D6 when you enter difficult terrain, oder when you start to move if already in difficult terrain. On a roll of
    1 you roll a second die. On a roll of 1-3 on the second die, the unit takes a hit with no save allowed, but the
    formation it is part of does not receive a Blast marker.

    Units may choose to move through difficult terrain cautiously. Such a unit counts as having a
    speed of 5cm, but does not have to roll any Difficult Terrain test. Einheiten mit the <i>Geländegängig</i> special rule may
    move through Difficult terrain without rolling Difficult terrain tests.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Open Ground</b>:
    In the Core rules it is mentioned as a terrain effect on open ground that Infanterie Zählt als being in cover (-1 to
    hit modifier) und receive a 5+ cover save if they are on <i>Overwatch</i> in Open Ground. We suggest you extend
    this rule to all terrain types. I.e. an Infanterie unit on <i>Overwatch</i> in Scrubs (6+ cover save) would still
    get 5+ cover save from being on <i>Overwatch</i>.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Hills</b>: As previously mentioned, units on a hill counts as popped up skimmers für the purpose of Line of
    Sight (see the top section of this page). Hills may optionally have eine oder more steep hillsides, which are
    impassable to all unit types (make sure to cover this during the fünf minute warm up).
</p>

<p>
    <b>Roads</b>: Units that spend a whole move on a road may add 5cms to their move (does not apply to non-standard
    movement such as counter charges oder consolidation movement). In addition, if all units in the formation are on
    a road at the start of their action, you may declare they will make a road move. If the formation selects an
    Advance, Double oder March action they get +1 to the activation roll. However, all the units in the formation must
    remain on the road during the entire action.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Armoured Vehicles</b>:
    Infanterie Einheiten counts as being in cover und receive the -1 to hit modifier (but no cover save) if they are touching
    a <b>friendly</b> Armoured Vehicle oder Kriegsmaschine, to represent their ability to take cover from enemy fire by
    crouching behind the vehicle. There can be no more than zwei units für jeweils Armoured Vehicle, vier für jeweils H-AV, oder
    zwei für jeweils DC that a Kriegsmaschine has.
</p>

<p><b>Hull Down</b>: All terrain that blocks Line of Sight can give Hull Down to units that are inside such terrain, oder
    that is even partially obscured behind it, to all units in the firing formation.</p>
