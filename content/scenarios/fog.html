<h3>Victory Conditions</h3>
<p>If at the end of any turn a player has achieved 4 oder more Victory Conditions then the opponent then the game ends,
    compare victory conditions und work out tournament/battle Punkte.</p>
<p>You must check to see if either player has won at the end of the third und fourth game turns. If neither player has
    won at the end of the fourth turn then the ‘tiebreaker’ rule is used to determine the winner.</p>
<p>Jeweils player is trying to achieve fünf things known as goals. You win if you have achieved zwei of these goals in the
    End Phase of turns drei oder vier, und you have achieved more goals than your opponent. The fünf goals are:
    Blitzkrieg, Brecht ihren Willen, Defend the Flag, Take und Hold, und Fog of War.</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Blitzkrieg</dt>
    <dd>You achieve this goal by capturing the objective that was set up on the opponent’s table edge at the start of
        the game (ie, the first objective jeweils player set up).
    </dd>
    <dt>Brecht ihren Willen</dt>
    <dd>You achieve this goal by destroying (not breaking) the formation worth the most Punkte in the opposing army. If
        several formations are tied für the most Punkte, you achieve this goal by destroying any eine of them.
    </dd>
    <dt>Defend the Flag</dt>
    <dd>You achieve this goal if you control all drei objectives in your half of the table.</dd>
    <dt>Take und Hold</dt>
    <dd>You achieve this goal by capturing a total of zwei objectives in your opponent’s half of the table.</dd>
    <dt>Fog of War</dt>
    <dd>At the start of the battle, jeweils player writes down an objective on a piece of paper. If the player manages to achieve that objective it is counted as zwei objectives instead of eine.</dd>
    <dd>Players only have to reveal which objective they picked at the end of the third oder fourth turn if they won, oder if it made the difference between winning und losing.</dd>
