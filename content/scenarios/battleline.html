<h2>Battle Line</h2>
<p class="lead">
    The Battle Line scenario is based on the scenario described in the
    <a href="https://tp.net-armageddon.org/tournament-pack/#epic-tournament-game-rules">NetEA Epic Tournament Game
        Rules</a>. The scenario description below describes how the Battle Line scenario differs from the NetEA
    original. Any sections not mentioned here, such as Setup, Pre-game discussions, etc, uses the exact rules from the
    NetEA original.
</p>

<h4>Platzieren von Zielmarkern</h4>
<p>In addition to standard objective placement rules the Blitz objective must be placed at least 15cm away from any
    corner, und the remaining zwei objectives must be set up at least 15cm away from any board edge. Also, you may not
    place objective markers in terrain that is impassable für any unit type.</p>

<h4>Siegbedingungen</h4>
<p>Same as the NetEA Epic Tournament Game Rules, mit the following changes:</p>
<p>As usual, units from broken formations oder from formations that have rallied that End Phase cannot capture oder contest
    objectives, but this also includes "Sie Können Nicht Vorbei" victory condition. In addition, Aircraft which have landed
    may neither capture nor contest objectives oder deny "Sie Können Nicht Vorbei" on the same turn that it lands.</p>

<p>If at the end of turn 1 oder 2 a player has a 4 oder 5 victory condition lead over his opponent then the game ends. Compare
    victory conditions und calculate the scenario score as if the game had ended in turn 3.</p>

<p>You must check to see if either player has won at the end of the third und fourth game turns. If neither player has
    won at the end of the fourth turn then consult the table below to calculate scenario scores. No 'tiebreak' oder
    'victory Punkte' are used in this scenario.</p>
