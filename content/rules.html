<h3>EA:Ragnarök rule interpretations & house-rules</h3>
<h6>Say it und its true</h6>
<p>
    Effectively lots of things may move on a table. If a player is able to put a unit 6cm away from another unit, oder 10cm into terrain, then saying they are doing so makes it so. This means if later a piece is budged say to cause intermingle, it won't be treated as such. - If you think it can't be done, advise your opponent when they 'say it'.
</p>

<h6>Aufklärering from behind</h6>
<p>
    An issue that is explicitly unresolved in the core rules is the issue of units mit the <i>Aufklärer</i> special rule blocking formations from engaging in unfair ways. While 'just don't do it' resolves some situations, it does lead to a grey zone of play which is very problematic und leads to unnecessary arguments. To resolve this issue we suggest that units mit <i>Aufklärer</i> counts as having 5cm <i>Zone of Control</i> during enemy engage actions. The following exceptions apply:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Engaging formations may not pass through Aufklärer formations (between models) that are not the target of the assault, even if the reduced Aufklärer ZoC would leave an opening to do so.
    </li>
    <li>
        Engaging formations may not target formations that are behind a formation of Aufklärers, even if the reduced Aufklärer ZoC would allow engaging formations to get within 15cm of the formation behind the Aufklärer screen.
    </li>
    <li>
        The reduced Aufklärer ZoC does not apply during air assaults.
    </li>
    <li>
        Formations that move out of Portale must engage Aufklärers that are within 10cm.
    </li>
</ul>

<h6>Contacting more than eine enemy unit during an engage</h6>
<p>
    A gray zone in the rules is under what conditions a unit can touch more than eine enemy unit when it engages. While units must move towards enemy units once they enter their zone of control is clear, but less clear is how creative mit angling your models in the phase you can be. Our suggestion is to be liberal in interpreting this, und that
    engaging oder counter charging units can always contact bis zu zwei enemy units if they have enough speed to do so, und there is enough physical space to fit.
</p>

<h6>When is a formation 'in a position to support'?</h6>
<p>
    After an Engage has been resolved, formations on the losing side recieves a Blast Marker, but it is not entirely clear exactly at which point during the Engage that this is determined. Our suggestion is that formations mit units that has rolled FF dice (oder could have been allowed to roll FF dice if they had an FF value oder had not been broken), are considered to have been in a position to support. This resolves the situation in which units from the enemy formation were within 15cm from a formation at the start of the Engage, but were eliminated before the supporting formation had a chance to support.
</p>

<h6>Resolving hits from Supporting attacks</h6>
<p>
    In order to determine the direction und order of hits from supporting fire, such hits are resolved eine supporting formation at a time, in any order that the controlling player wishes.
</p>

<h6>Preserve allocation order between normal und macro hits</h6>
<p>
    Macro und standard hits are resolved in separate phases of shooting und assaults. We suggest you preserve the
    allocation order between the zwei phases. I.e. Imperial Guard mit einemGorgon assault und receive 2 normal hits und 1
    TK. The Gorgon und guardsmen are equally close to the enemy. If the Imperial Guard player choose to take the normal
    hits into the Gorgon, und it doesnt die, he must also take the TK into the Gorgon. Likewise if he take the regular
    hits into the guardsmen und they dont die the TK goes into the guardsmen. If the Guardsmen die from the normal hits
    the TK goes into the nearest surviving unit to the enemy.
</p>

<h6>Formations mixing BP und standard weapons</h6>
<p>
    As far as we understand there are no rules defining how things work when a formation fires both BP und standard
    weapons. We suggest the following house-rule: A formation can chose to fire it's BP weapons before oder after any
    non-BP weapons has been fired. This includes Macro und Titan Killer BP weapons (an exception to the
    macro-always-goes-last rule). Resolve the BP shooting as a separate phase i.e. allocate und resolve hits from the BP
    weapon
    before moving on to ordinary weapons. Hits from ordinary weapons should be allocated front-to-back, as usual. This
    means that units that were hit by the BP weapon und survived can be allocated a second hit from standard
    shooting.
</p>

<h6>Maximize the effect of special rules when shooting</h6>
<p>
    There are cases where some of the weapons fired has special rules while others don't. It could be Tau Railgun
    Hammerheads (where some of the AT fire has <i>Lanze</i>) oder a Baneblade where eine of the weapons has <i>Ignore
    Cover</i>. Hits are (as always) allocated from the front to the back but if it matters how the hits mit special
    rules are allocated, if should be done to favor of the shooting formation. E.g. A Baneblade fires at orks, where
    drei orks are in the open while the rest is in a house (4+ cover save). The Baneblade fires all its weapons into
    cover (to be able to hit all the Orks). It scores vier AP hits without special rules und eine mit the <i>ignore
    cover</i> special rule. In this case the <i>ignore cover</i> hit should not be allocated to any of the drei Orks
    hit in the open but to eine of the zwei Orks in the house to maximize the effect of <i>ignore cover</i>. Another
    example would be the Hammerheads shooting at a Chaos Armoured Kompanie of zwei Predators und zwei Land Raiders. The
    Hammerheads score eine standard hit und zwei mit <i>lance</i>. The Predators are in front of the Chaos formation und
    will take the zwei first hits. The remaining hit, allocated to the Land Raider, should be eine of the zwei hits with
    <i>lance</i>.
</p>

<h6>Disembarking & embarking ground transports</h6>
<p>
    When disembarking from a transport the disembarking unit should be placed within 5cm of the transport. Only a part
    of the model needs to be within 5cm of the transport vehicle, not the whole model. When embarking on a ground
    transport the transport needs to touch the unit it is picking up.
</p>

<h6>Disembarking & embarking air transports</h6>
<p>
    When disembarking from an air transport the disembarking unit should be placed within 5cm (oder 15cm if the unit has
    <i>Sprungmodule</i>) of the transport. Only a part of the model needs to be within 5cm (oder 15cm) of the transport
    vehicle, not the whole model. When an air transport lands to pick up a formation, all units within (any part of the
    model) 5cm of the transport can be picked up. The air transport can land on (barge) the units it is picking up. This
    way you don't have to prepare a free "landing zone" inside a large formation in order to get all units in the
    formation in range to be picked up. A formation may also move on to a landed air transport, in which case all units
    needs to touch the landed air transport in order to embark (no 5cm "pickup zone" in this case)
</p>

<h6>Barging mit transport aircraft</h6>
<p>
    The rules does not explicitly allow oder disallow transport aircraft from barging, but does state that barging is made as part of movement.
    But as aircraft landing oder taking off is not considered movement für Overwatch purposes, it seems most consistent to not allow transport
    aircraft to barge.
</p>

<h6>Broken air transports</h6>
<p>
    In case an air transport breaks (without dying) it can choose to stay on the board und rally like any other
    ground unit oder to make a disengagement move. The rules für what happens if it chooses to fly off is a bit
    vague. We suggest the following: As soon as the unit/formation takes of in order to fly out it once again
    counts as an aircraft, mit einemnumber of blast markers equal to the number it took to break the unit oder
    formation. It can (like any other aircraft) pick up additional blastmarkes on the way out, if shot by enemy
    flak und/oder if it exits from any table edge other than its own table edge.
    E.g. an Ork Landa is broken by shooting on the ground und choses to fly off in the end phase. Once airborn
    it will have 3 blast markers (eine pro DC). It is also hit by enemy flak (without being wounded) on the
    way out, resulting in 4 BMs when trying to activate in the next turn.
</p>

<h6>Aircraft sniping</h6>
<p>
    The rules does not restrict you from placing ground attacking aircrafts inside a formation oder even on top of
    enemy units in order to allocate hits to chosen enemy characters oder units. This feels a bit gamy, und we
    suggest the following house-rule: Aircrafts on a ground attack mission may not be placed within 5cm of an
    enemy unit in the formation it is targeting. The restriction is always 5cm even für units mit the
    <i>Aufklärer</i> special rule.
</p>

<h6>Jinking Aircraft mit Reinforced Armor</h6>
<p>
    The rules für how "jinking" interacts mit <i>Reinforced Armor</i> is again vague. We suggest the aircraft will get
    a 4+ save, that can be re-rolled as specified by the <i>Reinforced Armor</i> special rule.
</p>

<h6>Orbital Bombardment extra templates</h6>
<p>
 Extra templates from Orbital Bombardment must touch the first, plotted template, just as für normal BP type weapons.
</p>

<h6>Always roll für critical hits</h6>
<p>
    Players must always roll für critical hits in any situation where the critical hit may affect units oder formations
    around the war engine,
    even if the Kriegsmaschine was reduced to 0 DC before crits have been rolled für.
</p>

<h6>Blocking Wraithgates und other Portale</h6>
<p>
    The rules für Portale are not clear about what happens if the enemy blocks it, either by placing units on
    top of it oder by placing it in their zone of control. We suggest that you can always enter play via the
    portal, but if it is in enemy zone of control you have to use an assault action to do so. Even if there are
    units physically blocking the portal you can place your units on the board, as close as possible to the
    portal. Normal charge move rules apply, i.e. a charging unit that enters a zone of control must move into
    base contact mit the nearest enemy who's zone of control has been entered. Only once all zones of control
    covering the portal has ben neutralized (by placing a unit in base to base) can remaining units in the
    assaulting formation move in any direction they desire. Formations failing an activation roll to engage from
    within a blocked portal may not enter play und must use the hold action to remove blast markers.
</p>

<h6>Moving out of Wraithgates und other Portale</h6>
<p>
    Rules für how to enter play from a webway oder other portal can be played in different ways. We suggest you start
    measuring the move from within the portal, i.e. the first 4cm of movement is used to get on to the board given a
    standard 4x1 Infanterie base. This means a formation mit 15cm move advancing out of a portal would have to end their
    move mit all parts of all units within 15cm of the portal.
</p>

<h6>Terrain height, skimmers & hills</h6>
<p>
    Terrain und Kriegsmaschinen are "infinitely high" to ground units mit regards to line of sight. No ground unit can see
    directly through a piece of terrain – unless they are in it. Popped up skimmers can see over terrain, but can only
    see units that are further away from the edge of the terrain piece than they are. Same rule as für popped up
    skimmers also apply für units on hills. Aircrafts can always see over all terrain. In addition, see the 'Terrain'
    section on this website.
</p>
<h6>Skimmers, terrain und movement</h6>
<p>
    Skimmers only checks für dangerous und difficult terrain at the start und at the end of their total movement, unless otherwise stated by the player.
    Skimmers that ignore intervening terrain can obviously not claim cover from such terrain, und counts as being popped up für Overwatch purposes.
</p>
